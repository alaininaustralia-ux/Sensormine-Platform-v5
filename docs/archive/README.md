## 🔍 When to Reference Archived Files

**Historical Context:** Use archived completion summaries to understand:
- Why certain architectural decisions were made
- Evolution of specific features
- Lessons learned from past implementations

**Migration Reference:** Use archived architecture docs to:
- Understand what changed during consolidation
- Track evolution of database architecture
- Reference old configuration formats

**DO NOT USE** archived files as current reference material. Always refer to the current consolidated documentation.

## 📝 Archive Policy

**Criteria for Archiving:**
1. Document superseded by consolidated documentation
2. Completion summaries after integration into main docs
3. Session notes after outcomes documented elsewhere
4. Historical analysis documents (keep for reference only)

**What NOT to Archive:**
- Current requirement documents
- Active user stories
- Technology stack documentation
- Service port references
- Permission matrices
- Deployment guides (unless superseded)
